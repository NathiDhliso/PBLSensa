## Troubleshooting

### Build fails after adding variables
- [ ] Check build logs in Amplify Console
- [ ] Verify all variable names are exactly as shown (case-sensitive)
- [ ] Make sure no extra spaces in values

### App loads but still shows error
- [ ] Hard refresh browser (Ctrl+Shift+R)
- [ ] Clear browser cache
- [ ] Try incognito/private window
- [ ] Check that new build actually completed

### Can't find Amplify Console
- [ ] Make sure you're logged into correct AWS account
- [ ] Check you're in correct region (eu-west-1)
- [ ] Verify app was actually deployed to Amplify

### Login doesn't work
- [ ] Verify Cognito User Pool ID is correct
- [ ] Verify Cognito Client ID is correct
- [ ] Check Cognito callback URLs include Amplify domain
- [ ] Test backend health: http://pbl-development-dev-alb-1605501788.eu-west-1.elb.amazonaws.com/health
