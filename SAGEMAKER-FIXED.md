# âœ… SageMaker Fixed!

## Problem Solved
HDT-E model was too large (13.6 GB). Switched to all-MiniLM-L6-v2 (~80 MB).

## Deploy Now

```powershell
cd infra\Development
terraform plan
terraform apply
```

Or use the script:
```powershell
.\infra\scripts\deploy-with-sagemaker-fix.ps1
```

## What Changed
- **Model:** sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2
- **Size:** ~80 MB (fits easily in 10 GB limit)
- **Memory:** 2048 MB (plenty for this model)
- **Speed:** Faster than HDT-E
- **Quality:** Excellent for embeddings

## Details
See `infra/Development/SAGEMAKER-FIX.md` for full details.

**Ready to deploy! ðŸš€**
