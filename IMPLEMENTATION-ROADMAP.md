# AWS Tech Stack Implementation Roadmap

## Phase 1: Foundation (Weeks 1-2)
**Goal:** Get basic PDF processing working locally

### Tasks:
1. **PDF Upload & Validation**
   - Implement Layer 0 locally in Flask backend
   - Add PyPDF2 for validation
   - Generate SHA256 hashes
   - Store files in local filesystem (migrate to S3 later)

2. **Basic PDF Parsing**
   - Integrate LlamaParse API (requires API key)
   - Fallback to PyPDF2 text extraction
   - Store extracted text in SQLite/PostgreSQL

3. **Simple Keyword Extraction**
   - Implement KeyBERT locally
   - Extract top 10-20 keywords per document
   - Return as JSON to frontend

**Deliverable:** Upload a PDF → Get keywords back

---

## Phase 2: AI Integration (Weeks 3-4)
**Goal:** Add intelligent concept mapping

### Tasks:
1. **AWS Bedrock Integration**
   - Set up AWS credentials
   - Connect to Claude 3.5 Sonnet
   - Implement prompt for concept relationship extraction

2. **Basic Concept Map Generation**
   - Use extracted keywords as nodes
   - Use Claude to identify relationships (edges)
   - Return graph structure to frontend

3. **Chapter Detection**
   - Parse PDF structure for chapters/sections
   - Generate per-chapter keyword lists

**Deliverable:** Upload PDF → Get interactive concept map

---

## Phase 3: Vector Search & RAG (Weeks 5-6)
**Goal:** Enable semantic search and context-aware generation

### Tasks:
1. **Embeddings Setup**
   - Choose embedding model (OpenAI, Cohere, or local)
   - Generate embeddings for chunks
   - Store in PostgreSQL with pgvector extension

2. **RAG Workflow**
   - Implement semantic search
   - Pass context to Claude for enhanced concept descriptions
   - Add "related concepts" feature

3. **Caching Layer**
   - Add Redis locally
   - Cache processed documents by hash
   - Implement versioning strategy

**Deliverable:** Semantic search + AI-enhanced concept descriptions

---

## Phase 4: AWS Migration (Weeks 7-9)
**Goal:** Move to production AWS infrastructure

### Tasks:
1. **Core Services**
   - Deploy RDS PostgreSQL with pgvector
   - Set up S3 buckets for PDFs
   - Configure ElastiCache for Redis

2. **Compute Migration**
   - Containerize Flask/FastAPI backend
   - Deploy to Fargate
   - Set up API Gateway with rate limiting

3. **Async Processing**
   - Implement SQS queue
   - Create Fargate worker tasks
   - Add DLQ for failed jobs

**Deliverable:** Fully cloud-hosted processing pipeline

---

## Phase 5: Advanced Features (Weeks 10-12)
**Goal:** Multi-document synthesis and exam integration

### Tasks:
1. **Course Management**
   - Implement course CRUD endpoints
   - Multi-document association
   - Cross-document concept merging

2. **Exam Processing**
   - Parse past exam PDFs
   - Calculate exam relevance scores
   - Highlight high-priority concepts

3. **User Feedback Loop**
   - Implement feedback endpoints
   - Weekly Lambda processor
   - Consensus-based improvements

**Deliverable:** Full multi-document course synthesis

---

## Phase 6: Production Hardening (Weeks 13-14)
**Goal:** Monitoring, security, and compliance

### Tasks:
1. **Observability**
   - AWS X-Ray tracing
   - CloudWatch dashboards
   - Alert configuration

2. **Security & Compliance**
   - Cognito authentication
   - GDPR data deletion endpoints
   - S3 lifecycle policies

3. **Feature Flags**
   - AWS AppConfig integration
   - A/B testing framework

**Deliverable:** Production-ready system

---

## Quick Start Options

### Option A: Minimal Viable Product (2-3 weeks)
Focus on Phase 1 + basic Phase 2:
- PDF upload → keyword extraction → simple concept map
- Use OpenAI API instead of full AWS stack
- SQLite database
- No caching, no async processing

### Option B: AWS-First Approach (Start with Phase 4)
If you have AWS credits/budget:
- Set up AWS infrastructure first
- Use managed services from day 1
- Faster to production but higher initial complexity

### Option C: Hybrid (Recommended)
- Phases 1-3 locally with mock/simple implementations
- Validate the concept and UX
- Then migrate to AWS (Phase 4+)

## Cost Estimates (First Year)

Based on the document's analysis:

**Development Environment:**
- RDS db.t3.micro: ~$15/month
- ElastiCache t3.micro: ~$12/month
- S3 + data transfer: ~$5/month
- **Total: ~$32/month**

**Production (Low Traffic):**
- RDS db.t3.small: ~$30/month
- ElastiCache t3.small: ~$25/month
- Fargate (2 tasks): ~$50/month
- SageMaker Serverless: Pay per inference (~$20-100/month)
- Bedrock API calls: ~$50-200/month
- **Total: ~$175-405/month**

**Production (Medium Traffic):**
- Scale up to ~$800-1200/month

## Next Steps

Choose your approach and I can help you:

1. **Start Phase 1** - Set up PDF processing in your Flask backend
2. **Configure AWS** - Update your Terraform configs for the full stack
3. **Create detailed tasks** - Break down any phase into specific implementation steps
4. **Review architecture** - Discuss trade-offs and alternatives
