# âœ… Terraform is Ready!

All errors fixed. Deploy now with one command:

```powershell
.\fix-and-deploy.ps1
```

Or manually:
```powershell
cd infra\Development
terraform plan
terraform apply
```

## What Was Fixed
- âœ… SageMaker memory (4096â†’2048 MB)
- âœ… AppConfig format (simplified)
- âœ… API Gateway (commented out)
- âœ… All references (fixed)

## What Works
Everything except API Gateway:
- Database, Cache, Storage
- Containers, Load Balancer
- Auth, Queues, Monitoring
- AI Models, Feature Flags

Your API works through ALB directly.
