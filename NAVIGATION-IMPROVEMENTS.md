# Navigation Improvements - Back Buttons Added

## Summary
Added back buttons throughout the application for a delightful user experience. Users can now easily navigate back to previous pages from any screen.

## Changes Made

### 1. **New Page Created**
- **SensaCourseDetailPage** (`src/pages/sensa/SensaCourseDetailPage.tsx`)
  - New dedicated page for viewing individual courses in Sensa Learn portal
  - Includes back button to Sensa Learn dashboard
  - Shows course details with personalized learning features preview
  - Properly handles loading and error states

### 2. **Back Buttons Added to Existing Pages**

#### CoursesListPage
- **Location**: Top of page, before header
- **Navigation**: Back to PBL Portal (`/pbl`)
- **Icon**: ArrowLeft
- **Style**: Ghost button

#### ProfilePage
- **Location**: Top of page, before profile card
- **Navigation**: Back to Dashboard (`/dashboard`)
- **Icon**: ArrowLeft
- **Style**: Ghost button

#### ProcessingStatusPage
- **Location**: Top of page, before status card
- **Navigation**: Back to Courses (`/pbl/courses`)
- **Icon**: ArrowLeft
- **Style**: Ghost button
- **Layout**: Changed from centered to top-aligned for better UX

### 3. **Pages That Already Had Back Buttons**
These pages already had proper navigation:
- ✅ **SensaDashboardPage** - Back to Portals
- ✅ **PBLDashboardPage** - Back to Portals
- ✅ **ConceptMapPage** - Back to Course
- ✅ **CourseDetailPage** - Back to Courses (in breadcrumb)
- ✅ **PortalSelectionPage** - Has Profile and Logout buttons

### 4. **Routing Updates**
- Updated `src/App.tsx` to use new `SensaCourseDetailPage` for `/sensa/course/:courseId` route
- Updated `src/pages/sensa/index.ts` to export the new page

## Navigation Flow

```
Portal Selection (/)
├── PBL Portal (/pbl)
│   ├── [Back to Portals]
│   └── Courses List (/pbl/courses)
│       ├── [Back to PBL Portal]
│       └── Course Detail (/pbl/courses/:id)
│           ├── [Back to Courses]
│           └── Concept Map (/courses/:id/concept-map)
│               └── [Back to Course]
│
├── Sensa Learn (/sensa)
│   ├── [Back to Portals]
│   └── Course Detail (/sensa/course/:id)
│       └── [Back to Sensa Learn]
│
├── Profile (/profile)
│   └── [Back to Dashboard]
│
└── Processing Status (/processing/:taskId)
    └── [Back to Courses]
```

## User Experience Benefits

1. **Consistent Navigation**: Every page now has a clear way to go back
2. **Visual Consistency**: All back buttons use the same ArrowLeft icon and ghost button style
3. **Logical Flow**: Back buttons navigate to the most logical previous page
4. **No Dead Ends**: Users are never stuck on a page without navigation options
5. **Mobile Friendly**: Back buttons are clearly visible and easy to tap

## Connection Refused Errors

The console errors you're seeing (`ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED`) are expected when the backend at `http://localhost:8000` is not running. The app has:

1. **Retry Logic**: Automatically retries failed requests (3 attempts with exponential backoff)
2. **Mock Fallback**: Falls back to mock data when backend is unavailable (see `MOCK-FALLBACK-COMPLETE.md`)
3. **Graceful Degradation**: Shows appropriate loading and error states

To resolve the connection errors, you need to:
1. Start the backend server (see `BACKEND-DEPLOYMENT-GUIDE.md`)
2. Or continue using mock data (the app works without the backend)

## Testing Checklist

- [x] All pages compile without errors
- [x] Back buttons added to all necessary pages
- [x] Navigation flow is logical and consistent
- [x] New Sensa course detail page created
- [x] Routing properly configured
- [x] TypeScript types are correct

## Next Steps

To test the navigation improvements:
1. Run `npm run dev` to start the development server
2. Navigate through the app and test all back buttons
3. Verify that each back button takes you to the expected page
4. Check that the new Sensa course detail page works correctly
