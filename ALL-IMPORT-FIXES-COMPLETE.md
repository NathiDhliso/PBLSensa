# âœ… All Import Fixes Complete!

## Files Fixed

### 1. question_generator.py âœ…
```python
# BEFORE:
from models.concept import Concept

# AFTER:
from models.pbl_concept import Concept
```

### 2. cross_document_learning.py âœ…
```python
# BEFORE:
from models.concept import Concept

# AFTER:
from models.pbl_concept import Concept
```

## Why These Fixes Work

Both Sensa services work with **PBL concepts**:

1. **Question Generator** â†’ Generates questions about PBL concepts
2. **Cross-Document Learning** â†’ Suggests analogies for PBL concepts

The flow is:
```
PDF â†’ PBL Pipeline â†’ Extract Concepts â†’ Sensa Services â†’ Personalize
```

So Sensa services need to import from `pbl_concept.py` (the source of truth).

## Verification

âœ… No more imports of old `models.concept`
âœ… No more imports of old `models.relationship`
âœ… All Sensa services use PBL models
âœ… No syntax errors

## ðŸš€ Backend Should Now Start

```bash
cd backend
python main.py
```

Expected output:
```
âœ… Database connected - PBL features enabled
INFO:     Started server process [PID]
INFO:     Waiting for application startup.
INFO:     Application startup complete.
INFO:     Uvicorn running on http://127.0.0.1:8000
```
