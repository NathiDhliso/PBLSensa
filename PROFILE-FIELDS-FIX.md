# Profile Fields Not Saving - Fix Summary

## Issues Found and Fixed

### 1. Backend Not Persisting Data
**Problem:** The `/profile` PUT endpoint was returning mock data without actually saving changes to storage.

**Fix:** 
- Added `profile_db` dictionary in `backend/app.py` to store profile data in memory
- Updated GET endpoint to retrieve stored profiles or create defaults
- Updated PUT endpoint to actually save all profile fields to storage
- Added debug logging to track what data is being received and saved

### 2. Empty String vs Undefined Handling
**Problem:** Form fields were sending empty strings (`""`) instead of `undefined` for unselected optional fields, which could cause issues with validation and storage.

**Fix:**
- Added data cleaning in `ProfileEditForm.tsx` to convert empty strings to `undefined` for optional fields
- Updated backend to handle both empty strings and null values properly

### 3. Learning Preferences Not Displayed
**Problem:** The ProfileView component only showed basic fields (name, email, age, location, interests) but didn't display learning preferences (learning style, education level, background).

**Fix:**
- Enhanced `ProfileView.tsx` to include a "Learning Preferences" section
- Added formatting functions for learning style and education level display
- Now shows all profile fields including:
  - Learning Style (Visual, Auditory, Kinesthetic, Reading/Writing)
  - Education Level (High School, Undergraduate, Graduate, Professional)
  - Background (free text)

## Files Modified

1. **backend/app.py**
   - Added `profile_db` storage
   - Enhanced GET `/profile` endpoint
   - Enhanced PUT `/profile` endpoint with proper field handling
   - Added debug logging

2. **src/components/profile/ProfileEditForm.tsx**
   - Added data cleaning before submission
   - Added console logging for debugging

3. **src/components/profile/ProfileView.tsx**
   - Added learning preferences section
   - Added formatting functions for display
   - Enhanced UI to show all profile fields

## How to Test

1. Make sure the backend is running (`python backend/app.py`)
2. Navigate to the profile page
3. Click "Edit Profile"
4. Fill in all fields:
   - Name (required)
   - Age Range (dropdown)
   - Location (text)
   - Interests (tags - press Enter to add)
   - Learning Style (dropdown)
   - Education Level (dropdown)
   - Background (text)
5. Click "Save Changes"
6. Verify all fields are displayed correctly in the profile view
7. Edit again to verify values are retained

## Notes

- The current implementation uses in-memory storage, so data will be lost when the backend restarts
- For production, connect to a real database (PostgreSQL/RDS)
- Debug logging is enabled - check the backend console to see what data is being received
- All fields except "Name" are optional
- Interests field supports up to 20 tags with autocomplete suggestions

## Next Steps

If fields are still not saving:
1. Check the browser console for any JavaScript errors
2. Check the backend console for the debug logs showing received data
3. Verify the backend is running on the correct port (8000)
4. Check network tab in browser DevTools to see the actual API request/response
