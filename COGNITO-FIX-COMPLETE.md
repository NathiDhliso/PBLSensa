# ✅ Cognito 400 Error Fixed + Email Templates Guide

## 🎯 Problem Solved

**Error:** `cognito-idp.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/:1 Failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 400 () - A client attempted to write unauthorized attribute`

**Root Cause:** The signup process was trying to send the `name` attribute to Cognito, but this attribute wasn't configured as writable during the signup phase.

---

## ✅ Code Fix Applied

### File Updated: `src/services/auth.ts`

**Before:**
```typescript
const result = await amplifySignUp({
  username: email,
  password,
  options: {
    userAttributes: {
      email,
      ...attributes,  // ❌ This was sending 'name' and causing 400 error
    },
  },
});
```

**After:**
```typescript
const result = await amplifySignUp({
  username: email,
  password,
  options: {
    userAttributes: {
      email,  // ✅ Only sending email now
      // Note: 'name' and other attributes are not sent during signup
      // They can be updated later via updateUserAttributes if needed
    },
  },
});
```

## 📧 Email Templates Setup Required

You still need to configure email templates in AWS Cognito Console for:

1. ✉️ **Verification Email** - Sent when users sign up
2. 🔐 **Password Reset Email** - Sent when users request password reset
3. 👋 **Welcome Email** (Optional) - Sent after verification

### Quick Setup (5 minutes):

📖 **See detailed guide:** `infra/scripts/QUICK-FIX-COGNITO.md`

**TL;DR:**
1. Go to AWS Console → Cognito → User Pools → `eu-west-1_0kcNGnItf`
2. Click "Messaging" tab → "Email" section → "Edit"
3. Copy-paste the email templates from the guide
4. Save changes
5. Test!
