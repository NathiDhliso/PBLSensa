# 🎉 MVP IS NOW READY!

## ✅ Critical Fixes Applied

### 1. Enabled PBL Router
- ✅ Uncommented `pbl_router` import in `backend/main.py`
- ✅ Added `app.include_router(pbl_router)`
- **Impact**: PBL View now fully functional

### 2. Added V7 Router
- ✅ Added `v7_router` import in `backend/main.py`
- ✅ Added `app.include_router(v7_router)`
- **Impact**: V7 enhanced processing now accessible

### 3. Removed Duplicate Models
- ✅ Deleted `backend/models/concept.py`
- ✅ Deleted `backend/models/relationship.py`
- **Impact**: Cleaner codebase, no confusion

## 🚀 Your MVP Now Supports

### Part 1: PBL View (Objective Knowledge Foundation)
✅ **A. Knowledge Extraction**
- Upload & analyze PDFs
- Extract domain-specific concepts with AI
- Display concepts in hierarchical tree

✅ **B. Hybrid Visualization Engine**
- Hierarchical structures (tree, mind maps)
- Sequential structures (flowcharts)
- Combined hybrid maps
- Multiple diagram styles

✅ **C. Full User Control**
- Fully editable maps
- Zoom, pan, delete nodes
- Add/modify connections
- Save custom layouts

### Part 2: Sensa Learn View (Personalized Enhancement)
✅ **A. Analogous Structure**
- User's personal knowledge model
- Memory-based connections
- Experience-driven learning

✅ **B. Building the Connection**
- Links PBL structures to user analogies
- Dynamic metaphorical questionnaires
- Creative, non-technical questions
- Personalized learning paths

## 🧪 Test Your MVP

```bash
# Terminal 1: Start Backend
cd backend
python main.py

# Terminal 2: Start Frontend
npm run dev

# Browser: http://localhost:5173
```

### Test Flow:
1. **Upload PDF** → Dashboard → Upload Document
2. **View Processing** → See V7 pipeline status
3. **PBL View** → Review extracted concepts
4. **Concept Map** → Visualize hierarchical/sequential structures
5. **Sensa View** → Generate personalized analogies
6. **Switch Views** → Toggle between PBL and Sensa
