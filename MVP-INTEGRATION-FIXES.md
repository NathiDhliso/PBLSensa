# MVP Integration Fixes Required

## Current Status: 95% Complete ‚ö†Ô∏è

Your two-view system is **almost fully functional**, but there are 2 critical integration issues preventing the MVP from working end-to-end.

---

## üö® CRITICAL FIXES NEEDED

### Fix 1: Enable PBL Router in main.py

**Problem**: The PBL router is commented out in `backend/main.py`

**Location**: Line 24-25 in `backend/main.py`
```python
# PBL router temporarily disabled - has incomplete model definitions
# from routers.pbl_documents import router as pbl_router
```

**Impact**: 
- PBL View cannot access concepts/relationships
- Document processing works but results aren't accessible via API
- Frontend PBL pages will fail to load data

**Fix**: Uncomment the router import and include it

```python
# CHANGE THIS:
# from routers.pbl_documents import router as pbl_router
# app.include_router(pbl_router)  # Will enable once database is connected

# TO THIS:
from routers.pbl_documents import router as pbl_router
app.include_router(pbl_router)
```

### Fix 2: Add V7 Router to main.py

**Problem**: The V7 router exists but isn't included in main.py

**Location**: `backend/routers/v7_documents.py` exists but not imported

**Impact**:
- V7 enhanced processing not accessible via API
- Frontend V7 status/metrics components won't work
- Missing v7-specific endpoints

**Fix**: Add V7 router to main.py

```python
# ADD THIS IMPORT:
from routers.v7_documents import router as v7_router

# ADD THIS INCLUDE:
app.include_router(v7_router)
```

## üìã OPTIONAL ENHANCEMENTS (Not MVP-Critical)

These features are built but not integrated. They enhance the experience but aren't required for MVP:

### 1. Feedback System (Medium Priority)
**Files**:
- `src/components/pbl/FeedbackPanel.tsx`
- `src/components/pbl/FlagIncorrectModal.tsx`
- `src/components/pbl/SuggestEditModal.tsx`
- `src/components/pbl/AddRelatedConceptModal.tsx`
- `src/hooks/useFeedback.ts`
- `src/services/feedbackService.ts`

**Integration**: Add to `PBLDocumentPage.tsx` and `ConceptValidationPage.tsx`

**Benefit**: Users can flag incorrect concepts and suggest improvements

---

### 2. Conflict Resolution (Medium Priority)
**Files**:
- `src/components/pbl/ConflictResolutionModal.tsx`
- `src/hooks/useConflicts.ts`
- `src/services/conflictService.ts`

**Integration**: Add to concept review workflow

**Benefit**: Handle conflicting concept definitions

---

### 3. Progress Tracking (Low Priority - Post-MVP)
**Files**:
- `src/pages/progress/ProgressDashboardPage.tsx`
- `src/components/progress/*`
- `src/hooks/useProgress.ts`
- `src/services/progressService.ts`

**Integration**: Add route in `App.tsx`, link from dashboard

**Benefit**: Gamification and motivation

---

### 4. Badge System (Low Priority - Post-MVP)
**Files**:
- `src/components/badges/*`
- `src/hooks/useBadges.ts`
- `src/services/badgeService.ts`

**Integration**: Add to progress dashboard

**Benefit**: Achievement system

---

### 5. Audio Features (Low Priority - Post-MVP)
**Files**:
- `src/components/audio/*`
- `src/components/music/*`
- `src/contexts/MusicPlayerContext.tsx`

**Integration**: Add to learning pages

**Benefit**: Audio narration and focus music

---

## üóëÔ∏è FILES TO REMOVE (Cleanup)

These are old models that have been replaced:

```bash
# Remove these files:
backend/models/concept.py          # Use pbl_concept.py instead
backend/models/relationship.py     # Use pbl_relationship.py instead
```

**Note**: Keep `analogy.py`, `question.py`, and `user_profile.py` - these are for Sensa View

## ‚úÖ WHAT'S ALREADY WORKING

### Backend (100% Complete)
- ‚úÖ V7 Pipeline with all enhancements
- ‚úÖ PBL Services (concept extraction, deduplication, relationships)
- ‚úÖ Sensa Services (analogies, questions, profiling)
- ‚úÖ Layer0 Services (caching, cost optimization)
- ‚úÖ Database migrations
- ‚úÖ All models defined

### Frontend (95% Complete)
- ‚úÖ PBL View pages and components
- ‚úÖ Sensa View pages and components
- ‚úÖ Concept Map visualization
- ‚úÖ View switcher
- ‚úÖ Document upload
- ‚úÖ Processing status display
- ‚úÖ V7 metrics dashboard

### Missing (5%)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è PBL router not enabled in main.py
- ‚ö†Ô∏è V7 router not included in main.py
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Optional features not integrated (feedback, conflicts, progress, badges, audio)

## üöÄ QUICK FIX STEPS

### Step 1: Enable Routers (5 minutes)

Edit `backend/main.py`:

```python
# Around line 24, uncomment:
from routers.pbl_documents import router as pbl_router

# Add new import:
from routers.v7_documents import router as v7_router

# Around line 45, uncomment:
app.include_router(pbl_router)

# Add new include:
app.include_router(v7_router)
```

### Step 2: Remove Old Models (2 minutes)

```bash
# Delete deprecated files:
rm backend/models/concept.py
rm backend/models/relationship.py
```

### Step 3: Test MVP (5 minutes)

```bash
# Start backend
cd backend
python main.py

# Start frontend (in another terminal)
cd ..
npm run dev

# Test flow:
# 1. Upload a PDF
# 2. View PBL concepts
# 3. Switch to Sensa View
# 4. Generate analogies
```
