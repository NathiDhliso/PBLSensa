##  Two-View Learning System
The goal is to create a two-step learning application. The PBL View builds an objective knowledge foundation from a document, which is then enhanced and personalized in the Sensa Learn View. The system will identify and visualize three core logical structures: Hierarchical, Sequential, and Analogous.

## Part 1: The PBL View (Objective Knowledge Foundation)
This is where the system deconstructs the source material into factual, logical structures.

A. Knowledge Extraction
Upload & Analyze: When a PDF is uploaded, the AI extracts key domain-specific concepts and their contextual definitions directly from the text.

Display Concepts: The extracted concepts are listed in a navigable hierarchical tree structure for user review.

B. Hybrid Visualization Engine
The system will identify two types of structures within the text and allow the user to visualize them in a combined, hybrid map:

Hierarchical Structure: Represents classifications, components, and "is-a" relationships.

Diagram Styles: Tree Diagrams, Mind Maps.

Sequential Structure: Represents processes, workflows, and step-by-step instructions.

Diagram Styles: Process Flowcharts, Swimlane Diagrams.

The user can apply different styles to different parts of the map, creating a single, logical diagram (e.g., a hierarchical tree of user types that branches into a sequential flowchart for creating a user).

C. Full User Control
The generated map must be fully editable, allowing the user to zoom, delete nodes, and add or modify connections.

## Part 2: The Sensa Learn View (Personalized Enhancement)
This is where objective knowledge is connected to the user's personal experience.

A. The Analogous Structure
This third logical structure is the user's unique personal knowledge model, built from their memories, experiences, and intuition.

B. Building the Connection
The system takes the Hierarchical and Sequential structures from the PBL View and enhances them by creating connections to the user's Analogous structure.

This link is created using dynamic, metaphorical questionnaires. The AI will ask creative, non-technical questions based on the new concepts to bridge the gap between the document's facts and the user's personal understanding.
