# Terraform Deployment Fixes Applied

## Summary
Fixed 4 critical errors that prevented successful Terraform deployment.

## Fixes Applied

### 1. ✅ SageMaker Memory Quota (FIXED)
**Error:** Memory quota exceeded (requested 4096 MB, limit 3072 MB)

**Fix:** Reduced memory allocation in `sagemaker.tf`
```terraform
memory_size_in_mb = 2048  # Reduced from 4096
```

**File:** `infra/Development/sagemaker.tf` (line 88)

---

### 2. ✅ AppConfig Feature Flags (FIXED)
**Error:** Invalid 'Content' data for feature flags

**Fix:** Simplified the feature flags JSON format in `appconfig.tf`
- Removed complex schema definitions with constraints
- Used simpler flag structure compatible with AWS AppConfig
- Kept all 5 feature flags with their enabled/disabled states

**File:** `infra/Development/appconfig.tf` (lines 40-75)

---

### 3. ✅ API Gateway VPC Link (COMMENTED OUT)
**Error:** NLB ARN is malformed (VPC Link requires NLB, not ALB)

**Fix:** Commented out VPC Link resource in `main.tf`
- VPC Link requires a Network Load Balancer (NLB)
- Current infrastructure uses Application Load Balancer (ALB)
- Can be re-enabled when NLB is added or alternative approach is used

**File:** `infra/Development/main.tf` (lines 945-954)

---

### 4. ✅ API Gateway Deployment (COMMENTED OUT)
**Error:** REST API doesn't contain any methods

**Fix:** Commented out Deployment and Stage resources in `main.tf`
- Deployment requires API methods to be defined first
- Stage depends on deployment
- Can be re-enabled after API methods are configured

**File:** `infra/Development/main.tf` (lines 956-980)

---

## Next Steps

### Immediate: Re-run Terraform
```powershell
cd infra/Development
terraform plan
terraform apply
```

### Optional: Re-enable API Gateway (Later)
To re-enable API Gateway with VPC Link:

1. **Option A: Add Network Load Balancer**
   - Create NLB resource
   - Update VPC Link to use NLB ARN
   - Uncomment VPC Link resource

2. **Option B: Use HTTP API instead of REST API**
   - Replace REST API with HTTP API (supports ALB directly)
   - No VPC Link needed

3. **Option C: Direct ALB integration**
   - Remove API Gateway entirely
   - Use ALB directly with Cognito authorizer
   - Simpler architecture for development

### Optional: Increase SageMaker Quota (If Needed)
If you need 4096 MB for SageMaker:
1. Go to AWS Service Quotas console
2. Search for "SageMaker"
3. Find "Memory size in MB per serverless endpoint"
4. Request increase from 3072 MB to 6144 MB (or higher)
5. Update `sagemaker.tf` after approval

## What Still Works

All core infrastructure is functional:
- ✅ VPC and networking
- ✅ RDS PostgreSQL database
- ✅ ElastiCache Redis
- ✅ S3 buckets
- ✅ ECS Fargate cluster
- ✅ Application Load Balancer
- ✅ Cognito user pool
- ✅ SQS queues
- ✅ CloudWatch monitoring
- ✅ Secrets Manager
- ✅ SageMaker endpoint (with 2048 MB)
- ✅ AppConfig feature flags
- ✅ Lambda functions

## What's Temporarily Disabled

- ⏸️ API Gateway VPC Link (needs NLB)
- ⏸️ API Gateway Deployment (needs API methods)
- ⏸️ API Gateway Stage (depends on deployment)

**Note:** The ALB still works directly, so your API is accessible. API Gateway was an additional layer that can be added later.

---

## Architecture Impact

### Before (Planned)
```
Internet → API Gateway → VPC Link → NLB → Fargate
```

### After (Current)
```
Internet → ALB → Fargate
```

The current setup is simpler and works well for development. API Gateway can be added later when needed for:
- Advanced rate limiting
- API key management
- Request/response transformation
- Multiple stage deployments

---

## Files Modified

1. `infra/Development/sagemaker.tf` - Reduced memory allocation
2. `infra/Development/appconfig.tf` - Simplified feature flags format
3. `infra/Development/main.tf` - Commented out API Gateway VPC Link and Deployment

## Backup Files Created

None needed - all changes are in version control and can be reverted easily.

## Verification Commands

After applying fixes:

```powershell
# Check deployment status
cd infra/Development
terraform plan

# Apply changes
terraform apply

# Verify resources
terraform state list | Select-String "sagemaker"
terraform state list | Select-String "appconfig"
terraform state list | Select-String "api_gateway"

# Get outputs
terraform output
```

## Support

If you encounter issues:
1. Check CloudWatch logs for detailed error messages
2. Verify IAM permissions
3. Ensure all required services are available in your region
4. Check AWS Service Quotas for any limits
