# Current Application Status

## ✅ What's Working

### Frontend
- ✅ React + TypeScript application
- ✅ Beautiful UI with Sensa Learn branding
- ✅ Complete authentication system (Cognito integration)
- ✅ **Mock API with full functionality**
- ✅ All features working in development mode

### AWS Infrastructure
- ✅ VPC with public/private subnets
- ✅ RDS PostgreSQL database (ready but not populated)
- ✅ ElastiCache Redis
- ✅ S3 buckets for file storage
- ✅ Cognito User Pool for authentication
- ✅ ECS Cluster configured
- ✅ Application Load Balancer
- ✅ ECR repositories (empty)
- ✅ All security groups and IAM roles

## ❌ What's Not Working

### Backend
- ❌ **No backend application deployed**
- ❌ No Docker images in ECR
- ❌ ECS services running but 0 tasks (can't find images)
- ❌ ALB returning 503 (no healthy targets)

## 🔧 Current Configuration

Your `.env.local` is now set to use **Mock API mode**:

```bash
VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:5173
VITE_ENABLE_MOCK_API=true
```

## 🚀 How to Use Your App Right Now

1. **Restart your dev server** (if running):
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Open** http://localhost:5173

3. **The app will work with mock data**:
   - Sign up / Login (uses real AWS Cognito)
   - Create courses (mock data)
   - Upload PDFs (simulated)
   - View concept maps (mock data)
   - All UI features functional

## 📊 What You Can Do

### Option A: Continue with Mock API (Recommended)
- Perfect for frontend development
- No AWS costs for backend
- All features work
- Great for demos and testing

### Option B: Deploy Real Backend
- Requires building a FastAPI application
- See `BACKEND-DEPLOYMENT-GUIDE.md` for details
- Will cost ~$100-150/month to run
- Needed for production use

## 💰 Current AWS Costs

With backend services stopped:
- **RDS** (if running): ~$50/month
- **ALB**: ~$16/month
- **Other services**: ~$5/month
- **Total**: ~$71/month

To reduce costs further:
```powershell
# Stop RDS when not needed
aws rds stop-db-instance --db-instance-identifier pbl-development-dev-db --region eu-west-1

# Start it again when needed
aws rds start-db-instance --db-instance-identifier pbl-development-dev-db --region eu-west-1
```

## 🎯 Recommended Next Steps

1. **Immediate**: Use mock API for development (already configured)
2. **Short-term**: Decide if you need a real backend
3. **If yes**: Build FastAPI backend following the guide
4. **If no**: Continue with mock API and save costs
