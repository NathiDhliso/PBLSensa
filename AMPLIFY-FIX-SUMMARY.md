# üéØ AMPLIFY ERROR - FIXED!

## What Was Wrong

Your AWS Amplify deployment had **missing environment variables**, causing:

```javascript
Uncaught Error: Missing required environment variables:
  - VITE_API_BASE_URL
  - VITE_AWS_REGION
  - VITE_COGNITO_USER_POOL_ID
  - VITE_COGNITO_CLIENT_ID
```

And a minor issue:
```
Failed to load resource: /vite.svg (404)
```

## üìã Your Environment Values

These are extracted from your `infrastructure-outputs.json`:

```env
VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://pbl-development-dev-alb-1605501788.eu-west-1.elb.amazonaws.com
VITE_API_TIMEOUT=30000
VITE_AWS_REGION=eu-west-1
VITE_COGNITO_USER_POOL_ID=eu-west-1_0kcNGnItf
VITE_COGNITO_CLIENT_ID=45fjtlck1bpvuealdo1nepikr4
VITE_ENABLE_MOCK_API=false
VITE_ENABLE_API_LOGGING=false
VITE_ENABLE_MOCK_AUTH=false
```

---

## üéì Why This Happened

Vite (your build tool) requires environment variables to be present during build time. They're loaded from:

1. `.env` files (for local development)
2. **Amplify Environment Variables** (for cloud deployments)

You had the infrastructure deployed, but Amplify didn't know about it!

The variables are checked in `src/config/env.ts` which throws an error if they're missing. This is actually **good security practice** - fail fast if config is wrong!

---

## üîê Security Notes

These variables are **safe to expose** in the frontend:
- ‚úÖ API Base URL - Public endpoint
- ‚úÖ AWS Region - Public info
- ‚úÖ Cognito IDs - Designed to be public
- ‚úÖ Feature flags - Not sensitive

**Never put these in frontend code:**
- ‚ùå API Keys
- ‚ùå Secret Access Keys
- ‚ùå Database credentials
- ‚ùå Private keys

## ‚úÖ After You Fix

You should see:
- ‚úÖ No console errors
- ‚úÖ Login page loads
- ‚úÖ Cognito authentication works
- ‚úÖ No 404 for favicon

## üÜò Need Help?

If it still doesn't work after following the guides:

1. Check Amplify build logs
