- [x] No diagnostic errors
- [x] Documentation complete

### Testing
- [x] Unit tests pass (`test_xml_migration.py`)
- [ ] Integration tests with real PDFs
- [ ] Test concept extraction accuracy
- [ ] Test analogy generation quality
- [ ] Test question generation
- [ ] Performance benchmarks

### Documentation
- [x] Migration guide created
- [x] Quick start guide created
- [x] XML format examples documented
- [x] Deployment checklist (this file)
- [ ] Team training materials
- [ ] Update API documentation (if needed)

## Deployment Steps

### 1. Backup Current State
- [ ] Backup database
- [ ] Tag current git commit
- [ ] Document current error rates
- [ ] Save baseline metrics

### 2. Deploy to Staging
- [ ] Deploy code changes
- [ ] Verify template files are accessible
- [ ] Run smoke tests
- [ ] Test with sample PDFs
- [ ] Monitor error logs

### 3. Staging Validation (1-2 days)
- [ ] Concept extraction working
- [ ] Analogy generation working
- [ ] Question generation working
- [ ] No increase in errors
- [ ] Performance acceptable

### 4. Production Deployment
- [ ] Deploy during low-traffic window
- [ ] Monitor error rates closely
- [ ] Check response quality
- [ ] Verify all services operational
- [ ] Alert team of deployment

### 5. Post-Deployment Monitoring (1 week)
- [ ] Track parsing error rate
- [ ] Monitor concept extraction accuracy
- [ ] Review analogy quality (sample)
- [ ] Check question generation
- [ ] Compare with baseline metrics

## Metrics to Track

### Before Deployment (Baseline)
- [ ] Parsing error rate: ____%
- [ ] Concept extraction success rate: ____%
- [ ] Average concepts per document: ____
- [ ] Analogy generation success rate: ____%
- [ ] Average response time: ____ms
- [ ] Token usage per request: ____

### After Deployment (Target)
- [ ] Parsing error rate: < baseline (target: -20%)
- [ ] Concept extraction success rate: > baseline (target: +10%)
- [ ] Average concepts per document: >= baseline
- [ ] Analogy generation success rate: > baseline (target: +15%)
- [ ] Average response time: <= baseline
- [ ] Token usage per request: <= baseline

### Week 1 Metrics
- [ ] Parsing error rate: ____%
- [ ] Concept extraction success rate: ____%
- [ ] Average concepts per document: ____
- [ ] Analogy generation success rate: ____%
- [ ] Average response time: ____ms
- [ ] Token usage per request: ____

## Rollback Triggers

Rollback if any of these occur:
- [ ] Parsing error rate increases by >50%
- [ ] Concept extraction fails for >30% of documents
- [ ] Critical service outage
- [ ] Data corruption detected
- [ ] Performance degrades by >100%

## Rollback Procedure

If rollback needed:
1. [ ] Revert to tagged commit
2. [ ] Restore JSON template files
3. [ ] Restart services
4. [ ] Verify system operational
5. [ ] Document issues encountered
6. [ ] Plan fixes before retry

## Success Criteria

Migration is successful if after 1 week:
- [ ] Parsing error rate decreased or stable
- [ ] Concept extraction quality improved
- [ ] No critical bugs reported
- [ ] Performance acceptable
- [ ] Team comfortable with new format

## Post-Migration Cleanup

After successful deployment (2+ weeks):
- [ ] Archive old JSON files
- [ ] Remove JSON fallback code (optional)
- [ ] Update team documentation
- [ ] Conduct team training
- [ ] Document lessons learned
- [ ] Update runbooks

## Communication Plan

### Before Deployment
- [ ] Notify team of upcoming changes
- [ ] Share documentation links
- [ ] Schedule training session
- [ ] Set up monitoring alerts

### During Deployment
- [ ] Announce deployment start
- [ ] Share monitoring dashboard
- [ ] Provide status updates
- [ ] Be available for questions

### After Deployment
- [ ] Share initial metrics
- [ ] Collect feedback
- [ ] Address issues promptly
- [ ] Document improvements

## Training Materials

### For Developers
- [ ] How to edit Markdown templates
- [ ] XML parsing best practices
- [ ] Debugging XML responses
- [ ] Using template loader utility

### For QA
- [ ] What to test
- [ ] Expected improvements
- [ ] How to report issues
- [ ] Quality metrics to track

### For Operations
- [ ] Monitoring dashboards
- [ ] Error patterns to watch
- [ ] Rollback procedure
- [ ] Escalation path

## Risk Assessment

### Low Risk
- Template file format change (internal only)
- XML parsing (well-tested)
- Backward compatibility maintained

### Medium Risk
- Claude response format change
- Potential parsing edge cases
- Performance impact unknown

### Mitigation
- Comprehensive testing
- Gradual rollout (staging first)
- Monitoring and alerts
- Quick rollback capability
- JSON fallback in structure classifier
