# 🚀 START HERE - Your MVP is Ready!

## What Just Happened

I've completed your two-view learning system MVP! Here's what was done:

### ✅ V7 Pipeline Integration (100%)
- Added concept deduplicator for cleaner results
- Added cost optimizer for lower costs
- Removed 3 deprecated files

### ✅ Critical MVP Fixes (100%)
- Enabled PBL router in main.py
- Added V7 router to main.py
- Removed duplicate models

## 🎯 Your Two-View System is Now Complete

### Part 1: PBL View ✅
Upload PDF → Extract concepts → Visualize hierarchical/sequential structures → Edit maps

### Part 2: Sensa Learn View ✅
Take PBL structures → Generate personalized analogies → Answer metaphorical questions → Build connections
