# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements a comprehensive Layer 0 PDF processing architecture that sits before the existing extraction pipeline. Layer 0 provides intelligent PDF validation, detection of document characteristics (scanned vs. digital), caching mechanisms to avoid redundant processing, and cost optimization strategies. This layer ensures reliability, performance, and cost-effectiveness for the PDF processing system.

The goal is to achieve 99% reliability while optimizing costs through intelligent caching and processing decisions, reducing processing time from minutes to seconds for previously processed documents.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: PDF Validation and Hashing

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want all uploaded PDFs to be validated and hashed before processing, so that we can detect corrupted files, prevent duplicate processing, and maintain data integrity.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a PDF file is uploaded THEN the system SHALL compute a SHA-256 hash of the file contents
2. WHEN a PDF hash is computed THEN the system SHALL check if this hash exists in the cache database
3. IF a matching hash is found THEN the system SHALL retrieve cached processing results instead of reprocessing
4. WHEN a PDF is uploaded THEN the system SHALL validate the file format and structure
5. IF a PDF is corrupted or invalid THEN the system SHALL reject the upload with a clear error message
6. WHEN a PDF passes validation THEN the system SHALL store the hash, file metadata, and validation timestamp
7. WHEN a PDF is validated THEN the system SHALL extract and store metadata (page count, file size, creation date, author)

### Requirement 2: Intelligent Document Detection

**User Story:** As a system, I want to automatically detect whether a PDF is scanned or digitally created, so that I can apply the appropriate processing strategy and optimize costs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a PDF is validated THEN the system SHALL analyze the document to determine if it is scanned or digital
2. IF a PDF contains primarily images THEN the system SHALL classify it as "scanned"
3. IF a PDF contains extractable text layers THEN the system SHALL classify it as "digital"
4. WHEN a PDF is classified as scanned THEN the system SHALL flag it for OCR processing
5. WHEN a PDF is classified as digital THEN the system SHALL use direct text extraction
6. WHEN document type is detected THEN the system SHALL store the classification with confidence score
7. IF a PDF is mixed (some scanned pages, some digital) THEN the system SHALL classify it as "hybrid" and process accordingly
8. WHEN detection is complete THEN the system SHALL estimate processing cost based on document type and page count

### Requirement 3: Multi-Level Caching System

**User Story:** As a cost-conscious administrator, I want the system to cache processing results at multiple levels, so that we avoid redundant API calls and reduce processing costs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a PDF hash matches an existing entry THEN the system SHALL return cached results immediately
2. WHEN processing results are generated THEN the system SHALL cache them with the PDF hash as the key
3. WHEN cached results are retrieved THEN the system SHALL update the last_accessed timestamp
4. IF cached results are older than 90 days and not accessed THEN the system SHALL mark them for potential cleanup
5. WHEN caching results THEN the system SHALL store: extracted concepts, relationships, structures, and embeddings
6. WHEN a cache hit occurs THEN the system SHALL log the cache hit for analytics
7. WHEN cache storage exceeds threshold THEN the system SHALL implement LRU (Least Recently Used) eviction policy
8. WHEN results are cached THEN the system SHALL compress data to minimize storage costs

### Requirement 4: Cost Optimization and Tracking

**User Story:** As a financial stakeholder, I want detailed cost tracking and optimization for PDF processing, so that we can monitor expenses and identify cost-saving opportunities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a document is processed THEN the system SHALL calculate and log the processing cost
2. WHEN calculating costs THEN the system SHALL include: Claude API calls, embedding generation, and storage costs
3. WHEN a cache hit occurs THEN the system SHALL log the cost savings compared to reprocessing
4. WHEN processing a scanned document THEN the system SHALL estimate OCR costs before processing
5. IF estimated costs exceed threshold THEN the system SHALL require admin approval before processing
6. WHEN processing is complete THEN the system SHALL generate a cost report with breakdown by operation
7. WHEN monthly costs are calculated THEN the system SHALL provide cost trends and optimization recommendations
8. WHEN cache hit rate is calculated THEN the system SHALL display it in the admin dashboard

### Requirement 5: Processing Pipeline Integration

**User Story:** As a developer, I want Layer 0 to seamlessly integrate with the existing extraction pipeline, so that the system maintains backward compatibility while adding optimization features.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Layer 0 processing is complete THEN the system SHALL pass validated PDFs to the existing extraction pipeline
2. IF a cache hit occurs THEN the system SHALL bypass the extraction pipeline entirely
3. WHEN passing to extraction pipeline THEN the system SHALL include document classification and metadata
4. WHEN extraction pipeline completes THEN the system SHALL update the cache with new results
5. IF extraction pipeline fails THEN the system SHALL NOT cache the failed results
6. WHEN processing status changes THEN the system SHALL update the status in real-time for the frontend
7. WHEN a document is reprocessed THEN the system SHALL invalidate old cache entries

### Requirement 6: Monitoring and Reliability

**User Story:** As a system operator, I want comprehensive monitoring and error handling for Layer 0, so that we can achieve 99% reliability and quickly diagnose issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any Layer 0 operation occurs THEN the system SHALL log the operation with timestamp and duration
2. WHEN an error occurs THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information including stack trace
3. WHEN processing fails THEN the system SHALL implement exponential backoff retry logic (max 3 retries)
4. IF all retries fail THEN the system SHALL alert administrators and mark the document as failed
5. WHEN system health is checked THEN the system SHALL report: cache hit rate, average processing time, error rate
6. WHEN cache operations fail THEN the system SHALL fall back to direct processing without blocking
7. WHEN reliability metrics are calculated THEN the system SHALL track successful vs. failed processing attempts
8. WHEN uptime is measured THEN the system SHALL maintain 99% availability for Layer 0 operations

### Requirement 7: Admin Dashboard and Controls

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want a dashboard to monitor Layer 0 performance and manage cache settings, so that I can optimize system performance and costs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing the admin dashboard THEN the system SHALL display cache statistics (hit rate, size, entries)
2. WHEN viewing cost analytics THEN the system SHALL show: total costs, cost per document, savings from caching
3. WHEN managing cache THEN the admin SHALL be able to manually clear cache entries
4. WHEN viewing processing logs THEN the admin SHALL be able to filter by date, status, and document type
5. WHEN setting cache policies THEN the admin SHALL be able to configure: TTL, max size, eviction policy
6. WHEN viewing document history THEN the admin SHALL see: hash, processing time, cost, cache status
7. WHEN exporting reports THEN the system SHALL generate CSV/PDF reports with cost and performance metrics

### Requirement 8: Performance Optimization

6. WHEN cache queries are executed THEN the system SHALL use database indexes for fast lookups
7. WHEN storing embeddings THEN the system SHALL use vector database optimizations
8. WHEN bandwidth is limited THEN the system SHALL implement compression for data transfer
