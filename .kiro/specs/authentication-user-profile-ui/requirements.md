# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Authentication & User Profile UI feature provides the user-facing interface for account management and personalization in the Sensa Learn platform. This feature builds on the existing AuthContext and auth service to deliver a complete authentication experience, including login, registration, password management, and user profile customization. The profile system enables personalized learning experiences by capturing user preferences (age range, location, interests) that inform AI-generated analogies and content recommendations.

This feature integrates with Amazon Cognito for authentication and the backend API for profile management, following the established brand theme and design system.
