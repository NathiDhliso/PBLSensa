# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enhances the existing authentication system to improve user experience, accessibility, security, and production readiness. The current authentication system provides basic login, registration, and password reset functionality but lacks comprehensive error handling, loading states, accessibility features, and security best practices needed for a production-ready application.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Enhanced Error Handling and User Feedback

**User Story:** As a user, I want clear and helpful error messages when authentication fails, so that I understand what went wrong and how to fix it.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user submits invalid credentials THEN the system SHALL display a specific error message indicating whether the email or password is incorrect
2. WHEN a network error occurs during authentication THEN the system SHALL display a user-friendly message explaining the connection issue
3. WHEN a user's account is locked or disabled THEN the system SHALL display a clear message with next steps
4. WHEN validation fails on form fields THEN the system SHALL display inline error messages next to the relevant fields
5. IF an error occurs THEN the system SHALL maintain form data so users don't have to re-enter information
6. WHEN an error is displayed THEN the system SHALL provide actionable guidance on how to resolve the issue

### Requirement 2: Loading States and Visual Feedback

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see clear loading indicators during authentication operations, so that I know the system is processing my request.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user submits a login form THEN the system SHALL display a loading spinner on the submit button
2. WHEN authentication is in progress THEN the system SHALL disable form inputs to prevent duplicate submissions
3. WHEN a password reset email is being sent THEN the system SHALL show a loading state with appropriate messaging
4. WHEN loading states are active THEN the system SHALL provide visual feedback that is accessible to screen readers
5. IF an operation takes longer than 3 seconds THEN the system SHALL display additional context about the delay
6. WHEN authentication completes THEN the system SHALL show a success state before redirecting

### Requirement 3: Accessibility Compliance

**User Story:** As a user with disabilities, I want the authentication system to be fully accessible, so that I can independently log in and manage my account.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user navigates with keyboard THEN the system SHALL provide visible focus indicators on all interactive elements
2. WHEN a screen reader is used THEN the system SHALL announce form errors and status changes
3. WHEN forms are displayed THEN the system SHALL include proper ARIA labels and descriptions
4. WHEN error messages appear THEN the system SHALL be associated with form fields using aria-describedby
5. IF a user uses keyboard navigation THEN the system SHALL support tab order that follows logical flow
6. WHEN color is used to convey information THEN the system SHALL also provide text or icon alternatives
7. WHEN modals or dialogs appear THEN the system SHALL trap focus and provide escape mechanisms

### Requirement 4: Security Enhancements

**User Story:** As a security-conscious user, I want my authentication data to be protected with industry-standard security practices, so that my account remains secure.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user enters a password THEN the system SHALL provide a toggle to show/hide password text
2. WHEN passwords are validated THEN the system SHALL enforce minimum security requirements (length, complexity)
3. WHEN a user creates a password THEN the system SHALL display a password strength indicator
4. WHEN authentication tokens are stored THEN the system SHALL use secure storage mechanisms
5. IF a user is inactive for 30 minutes THEN the system SHALL automatically log them out
6. WHEN a password reset is requested THEN the system SHALL implement rate limiting to prevent abuse
7. WHEN sensitive operations occur THEN the system SHALL log security events for audit purposes

### Requirement 5: Session Management

**User Story:** As a user, I want my login session to be managed intelligently, so that I stay logged in when appropriate but am protected when security risks exist.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user logs in successfully THEN the system SHALL create a secure session with appropriate expiration
2. WHEN a user's session expires THEN the system SHALL redirect to login with a clear message
3. WHEN a user closes the browser THEN the system SHALL respect "Remember Me" preferences
4. IF a user has "Remember Me" enabled THEN the system SHALL maintain session for 30 days
5. WHEN a user logs out THEN the system SHALL clear all session data and tokens
6. WHEN multiple tabs are open THEN the system SHALL synchronize authentication state across tabs
7. IF suspicious activity is detected THEN the system SHALL invalidate the session and require re-authentication

### Requirement 6: Password Reset Flow Improvements

**User Story:** As a user who forgot my password, I want a smooth and secure password reset experience, so that I can quickly regain access to my account.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user requests password reset THEN the system SHALL send an email within 1 minute
2. WHEN a reset email is sent THEN the system SHALL display a confirmation message with next steps
3. WHEN a user clicks a reset link THEN the system SHALL validate the token and show appropriate feedback
4. IF a reset token is expired THEN the system SHALL display a clear message with option to request a new link
5. WHEN a user sets a new password THEN the system SHALL validate it meets security requirements
6. WHEN password reset completes THEN the system SHALL invalidate all existing sessions
7. IF a user didn't request a reset THEN the system SHALL provide a way to report suspicious activity

### Requirement 7: Registration Flow Enhancements

**User Story:** As a new user, I want a guided registration process with clear validation, so that I can create my account successfully on the first try.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user enters an email THEN the system SHALL validate format in real-time
2. WHEN a user creates a password THEN the system SHALL show strength indicator and requirements
3. WHEN a user submits registration THEN the system SHALL check if email already exists
4. IF an email is already registered THEN the system SHALL suggest login or password reset
5. WHEN registration succeeds THEN the system SHALL send a welcome email

2. WHEN a user clicks social login THEN the system SHALL redirect to provider's authentication page
3. WHEN social auth succeeds THEN the system SHALL create or link account and log user in
4. IF a social email matches existing account THEN the system SHALL link accounts with user confirmation
5. WHEN a user links social account THEN the system SHALL store provider information securely

7. IF social auth fails THEN the system SHALL display clear error and fallback to standard login

### Requirement 10: Remember Me and Auto-Login
