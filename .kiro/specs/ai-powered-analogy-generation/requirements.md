# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The AI-Powered Analogy Generation feature is the core differentiator of Sensa Learn, transforming static educational content into personalized, relatable learning experiences. Currently, the application displays hardcoded mock analogies, but this feature will integrate AWS Bedrock to generate real-time, context-aware analogies based on user profiles, learning styles, and interests. This feature bridges the gap between abstract academic concepts and students' personal experiences, making complex material more accessible and memorable.

The system will analyze chapter content, extract key concepts, and generate multiple types of personalized learning aids including analogies, memory techniques, learning mantras, and complexity assessments. All generated content will be stored for reuse, rated by users for quality improvement, and refined over time through feedback loops.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: User Profile-Based Personalization

**User Story:** As a student, I want the system to generate analogies based on my personal interests and learning style, so that complex concepts become more relatable and easier to understand.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user completes their profile with interests and learning style THEN the system SHALL store this information in the database for analogy generation
2. WHEN generating analogies THEN the system SHALL retrieve the user's interests, learning style, and background from their profile
3. IF a user has specified interests (e.g., "cooking", "sports", "music") THEN the system SHALL incorporate these domains into analogy generation prompts
4. IF a user has specified a learning style (e.g., "visual", "kinesthetic", "auditory") THEN the system SHALL tailor analogy formats to match that style
5. WHEN a user updates their profile THEN the system SHALL regenerate analogies for previously viewed chapters using the new profile data
6. IF a user has no profile data THEN the system SHALL generate generic but high-quality analogies as fallback

### Requirement 2: Chapter Content Analysis and Concept Extraction
