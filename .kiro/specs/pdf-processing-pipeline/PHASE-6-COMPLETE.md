## 🎨 Design Patterns

### Color Coding

- **Green**: Sequential structures
- **Purple**: General concepts, primary actions
- **Warm colors (yellow→orange→red)**: Analogy strength
- **Gray**: Unclassified, neutral elements

### Visual Hierarchy
- **Borders**: Structure type indication
- **Shapes**: Rectangular (hierarchical), Rounded (sequential), Circular (default)
- **Line styles**: Solid (hierarchical), Dashed (sequential)
- **Opacity**: Highlighting and focus
- **Gradients**: Strength and importance

### Interaction Patterns
- **Hover**: Highlight + opacity changes
- **Click**: Open detail/edit modals
- **Drag**: Reposition nodes
- **Zoom**: Mouse wheel or buttons
- **Toggle**: View switcher, filters

## 🔗 Component Integration

### How Components Work Together

```
ConceptMapVisualization (Enhanced)
        ↓
ViewSwitcher → switches between
        ↓
PBL View (existing) ← structure-aware styling
        OR
Sensa Learn View → SensaLearnMap
        ↓
Displays: Concepts + Analogies
        ↓
Click Concept → QuestionForm
        ↓
Shows: AnalogyySuggestionPanel (if suggestions exist)
        ↓
User answers → AnalogyForm
        ↓
Creates → Analogy
        ↓
Displays in: AnalogyList + SensaLearnMap
```

### Data Flow

1. **User views concept map**
2. **ViewSwitcher** allows toggle between PBL and Sensa views
3. **PBL View**: Shows concepts with structure-aware styling
4. **Sensa View**: Shows concepts + analogies with connections
5. **Click concept** → Check for suggestions
6. **If suggestions exist** → Show AnalogyySuggestionPanel
7. **User can apply suggestion** OR **answer questions**
8. **QuestionForm** → generates questions based on concept structure
9. **User answers** → **AnalogyForm** creates analogy
10. **Analogy stored** → appears in **AnalogyList** and **SensaLearnMap**
