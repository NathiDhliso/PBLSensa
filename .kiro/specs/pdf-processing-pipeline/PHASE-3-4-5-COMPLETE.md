        ‚Üì
Question Generator ‚Üê (uses profile to personalize)
        ‚Üì
User answers questions
        ‚Üì
Analogy Service ‚Üê (creates analogy with AI explanation)
        ‚Üì
Cross-Document Service ‚Üê (suggests analogies for new concepts)
        ‚Üì

```

### Data Flow Example

1. **User uploads new document**
2. **Concepts extracted** (from Phase 1)
3. **User clicks "Create Analogy" on a concept**
4. **Question Generator** checks profile richness
5. **If rich profile**: Generates personalized questions using user's interests
6. **If new user**: Uses guided first experience templates
7. **User answers question** with personal experience
8. **Analogy Service** creates analogy:
   - Calls Claude for connection explanation
   - Auto-tags based on content
   - Stores in database
9. **Later, user uploads another document**
10. **Cross-Document Service** suggests relevant analogies:
    - Semantic search finds similar concepts
    - Ranks by relevance score
    - Shows top 3 suggestions
11. **User applies suggestion**
12. **New analogy created**, original usage count incremented
