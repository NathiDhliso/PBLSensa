# UI Overhaul - READY TO TEST! üéâ

**Date**: January 23, 2025  
**Status**: ‚úÖ Core files created, ready for integration  
**Next**: Add route and test

---

## ‚úÖ What's Been Created

### 1. API Service Layer
- ‚úÖ `src/services/sensaApi.ts` - Complete API client with all endpoints

### 2. React Hooks
- ‚úÖ `src/hooks/useSensaProfile.ts` - Profile management
- ‚úÖ `src/hooks/useSensaAnalogies.ts` - Analogy CRUD operations

### 3. New Pages
- ‚úÖ `src/pages/conceptMap/ConceptMapPage.tsx` - Two-View system with ViewSwitcher

### 4. All Phase 6 Components (Already Created)
- ‚úÖ ViewSwitcher
- ‚úÖ SensaLearnMap
- ‚úÖ AnalogyNode
- ‚úÖ ConnectionLine
- ‚úÖ QuestionForm
- ‚úÖ QuestionCard
- ‚úÖ AnalogyForm
- ‚úÖ AnalogyList
- ‚úÖ SuggestionCard
- ‚úÖ AnalogyySuggestionPanel
- ‚úÖ ProfileOnboarding

## üöÄ TO SEE THE NEW UI - DO THIS NOW:

### Step 1: Add Route to App.tsx

Open `src/App.tsx` and add this import at the top:

```typescript
import { ConceptMapPage } from '@/pages/conceptMap/ConceptMapPage';
```

Then add this route in your routes section:

```typescript
<Route path="/concept-map/:documentId" element={<ConceptMapPage />} />
```

### Step 2: Add Link from Sensa Dashboard

Open `src/pages/sensa/SensaDashboardPage.tsx` and add a button to navigate to concept map.

Find the course list section (around line 150) and add:

```typescript
<Button
  onClick={() => navigate(`/concept-map/${course.id}`)}
  variant="primary"
  className="mt-2"
>
  View Concept Map (Two-View System)
</Button>
```

### Step 3: Test It!

1. Run your app: `npm run dev`
2. Navigate to Sensa Learn
3. Click on a course
4. Click "View Concept Map (Two-View System)"
5. You should see:
   - ViewSwitcher at the top
   - PBL View with structure-aware styling (blue/green borders)
   - Toggle to Sensa Learn View to see dual-node visualization

---

## üé® What You'll See

### PBL View
- Concept map with structure-aware styling
- Blue borders = Hierarchical concepts
- Green borders = Sequential concepts
- Solid lines = Hierarchical relationships
- Dashed lines = Sequential relationships
- 4 layout options (Force, Tree, Flowchart, Hybrid)

### Sensa Learn View
- Blue concept nodes (read-only)
- Warm-colored analogy nodes (editable)
- Dashed connection lines
- Interactive hover effects
- Click to create/edit analogies

---

## üìù Current State

### Working with Mock Data
The system currently uses mock data:
- Mock concept map (3 concepts with relationships)
- Mock analogies (empty initially)
- Mock user ID

### To Connect Real Backend
1. Update `API_BASE` in `src/services/sensaApi.ts`
2. Replace mock data with real API calls
3. Get user ID from auth context
4. Done!

---

## üîÑ Complete Flow (Once Integrated)

1. User goes to Sensa Learn dashboard
2. Clicks on a course
3. Clicks "View Concept Map"
4. Sees PBL View with structure-aware styling
5. Clicks ViewSwitcher to toggle to Sensa Learn View
6. Sees concepts + their analogies
7. Clicks concept to create new analogy
8. Answers personalized questions
9. Analogy appears in visualization
10. Can edit, rate, and manage analogies

## üéØ Quick Test Checklist

- [ ] Add route to App.tsx
- [ ] Add button to SensaDashboardPage
- [ ] Run `npm run dev`
- [ ] Navigate to Sensa Learn
- [ ] Click course ‚Üí View Concept Map
- [ ] See ViewSwitcher at top
- [ ] Toggle between PBL and Sensa views
- [ ] Verify blue/green borders in PBL view
- [ ] Verify dual nodes in Sensa view

---

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### If ViewSwitcher doesn't appear:
- Check that ConceptMapPage is imported correctly
- Verify route is added to App.tsx

### If concept map is empty:
- Mock data is hardcoded in ConceptMapPage
- Should show 3 concepts (Database, Query, Schema)

### If analogies don't show:
- Analogies start empty (mock data)
- Need to connect to backend to see real analogies

## üìö Documentation

All documentation is in:
- `UI-INTEGRATION-GUIDE.md` - Detailed integration steps
- `COMPLETE-OVERHAUL-PLAN.md` - Full implementation plan
- `PROJECT-COMPLETE.md` - Overall project status

---

## ‚ú® What's Next

### Immediate (To See UI):
1. Add 2 lines to App.tsx (route)
2. Add 1 button to SensaDashboardPage
3. Test!

### Short Term:
1. Connect to real backend APIs
2. Replace mock data
3. Add real user authentication
4. Test end-to-end flow

### Long Term:
1. Add more visualization modes
2. Implement analogy editing
3. Add export features
4. Performance optimization
