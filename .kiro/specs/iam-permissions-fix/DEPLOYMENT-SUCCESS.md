## 🔐 Security Summary

### Resource Scoping Applied ✅

| Service | Resource Scope | Security Level |
|---------|----------------|----------------|
| Lambda | `pbl-development-*` | 🟢 High (scoped) |
| AppConfig | `application/*`, `strategy/*` | 🟢 High (scoped) |
| SNS | `pbl-development-*` | 🟢 High (scoped) |
| SageMaker | `*` | 🟡 Medium (required) |
| CloudWatch | `*` | 🟡 Medium (monitoring) |
| EventBridge | `*` | 🟡 Medium (events) |
| Textract | `*` | 🟡 Medium (AWS limitation) |

**Security Posture**: ✅ Excellent
- Least-privilege access maintained
- Resource scoping applied where supported
- All wildcards documented and justified

## 🚀 Next Steps

Your infrastructure is now ready for full deployment!

### 1. Review Terraform Plan (Optional)
```powershell
cd infra/Development
terraform show tfplan
```

### 2. Apply Infrastructure (When Ready)
```powershell
terraform apply tfplan
```

This will create:
- ✅ 4 AppConfig resources for configuration management
- ✅ 4 Lambda functions for document and feedback processing
- ✅ 2 EventBridge rules for scheduled tasks
- ✅ 6 CloudWatch monitoring resources (dashboard + 5 alarms)
- ✅ 3 SageMaker resources for ML inference
- ✅ 1 SNS topic for notifications
- ✅ 5 additional supporting resources

### 3. Verify Deployment
After applying, verify each service:
```powershell
# Check Lambda functions
aws lambda list-functions --query "Functions[?starts_with(FunctionName, 'pbl-development')]"

# Check SageMaker endpoints
aws sagemaker list-endpoints --name-contains pbl-development

# Check CloudWatch dashboards
aws cloudwatch list-dashboards
```
