## Context Detection Enhancements

### Context Signals (4 types)

1. **Shared Surrounding Concepts**
   - Checks for overlapping concepts in vicinity
   - Weight: Up to 0.3 in strength calculation

2. **Page Proximity**
   - Same page: 0.2 strength
   - Within 2 pages: 0.15 strength
   - Within 5 pages: 0.1 strength

3. **Same Sentence Co-occurrence**
   - Concepts appear in same sentence
   - Weight: 0.3 in strength calculation

4. **Mutual Mentions**
   - One concept mentions the other in definition/sentences
   - Weight: 0.2 in strength calculation

### Confidence Scoring Algorithm

```python
# Pattern matching confidence
dominance = category_score / (total_matches + 1)
strength = min(category_score / 3.0, 1.0)
pattern_confidence = (dominance * 0.6) + (strength * 0.4)

# Context strength (0.0 to 1.0)
context_strength = sum of context signals (capped at 1.0)

# Combined confidence for detection
combined_confidence = (pattern_confidence * 0.7) + (context_strength * 0.3)

# Final strength after Claude validation
final_strength = (claude_strength * 0.8) + (context_strength * 0.2)
```

## Testing Examples

### Test StructureClassifier

```python
from backend.services.pbl import get_structure_classifier
from backend.models.pbl_concept import Concept
from backend.models.pbl_relationship import Relationship, RelationshipType, StructureCategory
from uuid import uuid4
from datetime import datetime

# Create test concepts
vm_concept = Concept(
    id=uuid4(),
    document_id=uuid4(),
    term="Virtual Machine",
    definition="A software emulation of a physical computer system",
    source_sentences=["A VM is a type of computer system..."],
    page_number=5,
    surrounding_concepts=["Hypervisor", "OS"],
    structure_type="hierarchical",
    importance_score=0.85,
    validated=False,
    created_at=datetime.now()
)

computer_concept = Concept(
    id=uuid4(),
    document_id=uuid4(),
    term="Computer System",
    definition="A complete computing environment",
    source_sentences=["Computer systems include hardware and software..."],
    page_number=5,
    surrounding_concepts=["Hardware", "Software"],
    structure_type="hierarchical",
    importance_score=0.90,
    validated=False,
    created_at=datetime.now()
)

# Test classification
classifier = get_structure_classifier()

# Detect relationships
detected = await classifier.detect_relationships(
    concepts=[vm_concept, computer_concept],
    min_strength=0.3
)

print(f"Detected {len(detected)} relationships")
for rel in detected:
    print(f"  {rel.structure_category}: {rel.relationship_type} (strength: {rel.strength:.2f})")

# Test context strength
strength = classifier._calculate_context_strength(vm_concept, computer_concept)
print(f"Context strength: {strength:.2f}")
```

### Test RelationshipService

```python
from backend.services.pbl import get_relationship_service
from backend.models.pbl_relationship import RelationshipCreate, StructureCategory, RelationshipType
from uuid import uuid4

# Create service
service = get_relationship_service()

# Create relationship
rel_data = RelationshipCreate(
    source_concept_id=uuid4(),
    target_concept_id=uuid4(),
    relationship_type=RelationshipType.IS_A,
    structure_category=StructureCategory.HIERARCHICAL,
    strength=0.85
)

created = await service.create(rel_data)
print(f"Created relationship: {created.id}")

# Get by category
doc_id = uuid4()
hierarchical = await service.get_hierarchical(doc_id)
sequential = await service.get_sequential(doc_id)

print(f"Hierarchical: {len(hierarchical)}, Sequential: {len(sequential)}")

# Get statistics
stats = await service.get_statistics(doc_id)
print(f"Statistics: {stats}")
```

---

## What's Still Mocked

### 1. Claude API Integration
The `_call_claude()` method returns mock data:
```python
# TODO: Implement actual Bedrock client call
return json.dumps({
    "structure_category": "hierarchical",
    "relationship_type": "is_a",
    "direction": "A_to_B",
    "strength": 0.85,
    "reasoning": "Concept A is a type of Concept B"
})
```

**Will be implemented**: When Bedrock client is fully integrated

### 2. Database Operations
All RelationshipService methods return mock data:
```python
# TODO: Implement actual database query
return []
```

**Will be implemented**: When database layer is added (likely Phase 6 or 7)

## Design Decisions

### Why Two-Stage Classification?
1. **Pattern Matching**: Fast, deterministic, explainable
2. **Claude Validation**: Accurate, context-aware, flexible
3. **Best of Both**: Speed + accuracy, with fallback

### Why Context Weighting?
- Improves accuracy by considering proximity
- Reduces false positives from keyword matching
- Provides quantitative relationship strength

### Why Singleton Pattern?
- Consistent with other PBL services
- Easy to test and mock
- Reduces initialization overhead
- Shared Bedrock client instance

### Why Separate Service for Relationships?
- Single Responsibility Principle
- Easier to test and maintain
- Clean separation: classification vs. persistence
- Reusable across different contexts

## Performance Considerations

- Can be optimized with spatial indexing
- Consider caching for large documents

### Relationship Detection
- O(n²) complexity for n concepts
- Filtered by context first (reduces Claude calls)
- Batch processing recommended for large sets
