# Phase 1 Complete: Audio Integration

## Summary

Phase 1 of the Feature Integration Enhancement is complete! We've successfully implemented the audio coordination infrastructure and integrated audio narration across both PBL and Sensa Learn views.

## Completed Tasks

### ✅ Task 1: Audio Coordination Infrastructure
- Created `AudioCoordinationContext` to manage audio priorities
- Implemented volume ducking system (reduces music to 20% when narration plays)
- Integrated context into App.tsx provider hierarchy

### ✅ Task 2: Enhanced Music Player Context
- Added volume state management (0-1 range)
- Implemented `duckVolume()` and `restoreVolume()` methods
- Added localStorage persistence for volume preferences
- Implemented view-awareness (only shows in Sensa Learn view)

### ✅ Task 3: Audio Narration in ConceptCard
- Integrated AudioNarration component into ConceptCard (PBL view)
- Added coordination callbacks for music ducking
- Formatted narration text as "term. definition"
- Added `enableAudio` prop for flexibility

### ✅ Task 4: Enhanced AnalogyCard Audio Coordination
- Added audio coordination hooks to existing AudioNarration
- Implemented music ducking when narration starts
- Implemented volume restoration when narration stops

### ✅ Task 5: View-Based Music Player Visibility
- Added route detection using `useLocation` hook
- Music player only renders in Sensa Learn view (`/sensa/*`)
- State persists across view switches (music continues playing when hidden)

## Key Features Implemented

### Audio Priority System
1. **Audio Narration** (highest priority) - ducks music when playing
2. **Milestone Celebrations** (medium priority) - visual only when narration active
3. **Background Music** (lowest priority) - automatically ducked to 20% volume

### Volume Management
- User volume preferences saved to localStorage
- Automatic volume ducking when narration starts
- Automatic volume restoration when narration stops
- Prevents double-ducking with state tracking

### View-Aware Components
- Music player only visible in Sensa Learn view
- Audio narration available in both PBL and Sensa views
- State management maintains consistency across view switches

## Files Created

1. `src/contexts/AudioCoordinationContext.tsx` - Audio coordination state management
2. `.kiro/specs/feature-integration-enhancement/PHASE-1-COMPLETE.md` - This summary

## Files Modified

1. `src/contexts/MusicPlayerContext.tsx` - Added volume control and ducking
2. `src/App.tsx` - Added AudioCoordinationProvider
3. `src/components/music/FocusMusicPlayer.tsx` - Added view detection
4. `src/components/pbl/ConceptCard.tsx` - Added AudioNarration component
5. `src/components/sensa/AnalogyCard.tsx` - Added audio coordination
6. `src/components/audio/AudioNarration.tsx` - Added coordination callbacks
7. `src/types/audio.ts` - Added callback props to AudioNarrationProps

## Testing Recommendations

### Manual Testing
1. **PBL View Audio**
   - Navigate to PBL view
   - Open a concept card
   - Click "Listen" button
   - Verify audio plays
   - Verify music player is NOT visible

2. **Sensa View Audio + Music**
   - Navigate to Sensa Learn view
   - Start focus music player
   - Open an analogy card
   - Click "Listen" button
   - Verify music volume reduces to ~20%
   - Stop narration
   - Verify music volume restores

3. **View Switching**
   - Start music in Sensa view
   - Switch to PBL view
   - Verify music player disappears but music continues
   - Switch back to Sensa view
   - Verify music player reappears with same state

4. **Volume Persistence**
   - Adjust music volume
   - Refresh page
   - Verify volume setting persists

### Integration Testing
- Test multiple narrations in sequence
- Test rapid view switching
- Test narration + music coordination
- Test error handling (audio service unavailable)

## Next Steps

Ready to proceed with:
- **Task 6**: Create Milestone Definitions (reframe gamification)
- **Task 7**: Refactor Badge Components to Milestone Components
- **Task 8**: Create Milestone Celebration Component
- **Task 9**: Update Services and Hooks
- **Task 10**: Create User Preferences System

## Known Limitations

1. Audio service availability depends on backend configuration
2. Music player currently uses placeholder implementation (needs Brain.fm integration)
3. Volume ducking is immediate (could add smooth transitions)
4. No keyboard shortcuts for audio controls yet

## Architecture Notes

### Context Hierarchy
```
App
├── QueryClientProvider
├── AuthProvider
├── ToastProvider
├── MusicPlayerProvider
│   └── AudioCoordinationProvider
│       └── Application Components
```

### Audio Flow
```
User clicks "Listen"
  → AudioNarration.onNarrationStart()
  → AudioCoordinationContext.startNarration()
  → MusicPlayerContext.duckVolume()
  → Music volume reduces to 20%

User stops narration
  → AudioNarration.onNarrationStop()
  → AudioCoordinationContext.stopNarration()
  → MusicPlayerContext.restoreVolume()
  → Music volume restores to original
```

## Performance Considerations

- Audio caching implemented via existing `audioCache` utility
- Volume preferences use localStorage (synchronous, minimal impact)
- Context updates are optimized with useCallback
- Music player state maintained even when hidden (no recreation overhead)

## Accessibility

- Audio controls have ARIA labels
- Keyboard navigation supported
- Screen reader compatible
- Respects prefers-reduced-motion (existing implementation)
