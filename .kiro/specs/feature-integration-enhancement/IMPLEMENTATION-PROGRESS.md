# Feature Integration Enhancement - Implementation Progress

## Overview

This document tracks the implementation progress of the Feature Integration Enhancement spec, which focuses on integrating audio narration, music player positioning, and reframing gamification into a cohesive learning journey experience.

## Completed Phases

### ✅ Phase 1: Audio Integration (Tasks 1-5)

**Status**: Complete  
**Date Completed**: January 2025

#### Completed Tasks

1. ✅ **Audio Coordination Infrastructure**
   - Created AudioCoordinationContext
   - Implemented volume ducking system
   - Integrated into App.tsx

2. ✅ **Enhanced Music Player Context**
   - Added volume state management
   - Implemented duck/restore volume methods
   - Added localStorage persistence
   - Implemented view-awareness

3. ✅ **Audio Narration in ConceptCard**
   - Integrated AudioNarration component
   - Added coordination callbacks
   - Formatted narration text

4. ✅ **Enhanced AnalogyCard Audio Coordination**
   - Added audio coordination hooks
   - Implemented music ducking

5. ✅ **View-Based Music Player Visibility**
   - Added route detection
   - Music player only in Sensa view
   - State persists across views

#### Key Achievements

- **Audio Priority System**: Narration > Celebrations > Music

#### Completed Tasks

6. ✅ **Create Milestone Definitions**
   - Created milestoneDefinitions.ts
   - Rewrote content with professional language
   - Added insight messages
   - Changed category names (streak → consistency)

## Architecture Notes

### Current Context Hierarchy

```
App
├── QueryClientProvider
├── AuthProvider
├── ToastProvider
├── MusicPlayerProvider
│   └── AudioCoordinationProvider
│       └── Application Components
```

### Audio Flow

```
User Action
  ↓
AudioNarration Component
  ↓
AudioCoordinationContext
  ↓
MusicPlayerContext
  ↓
Volume Ducking (20%)
```

### Milestone System (Planned)

```
User Progress
  ↓
MilestoneService
  ↓
MilestoneContext
  ↓
LearningJourneyPanel
  ↓
MilestoneCelebration
```

## Performance Considerations

- Audio caching via existing audioCache utility
- Volume preferences use localStorage (minimal impact)
- Context updates optimized with useCallback
- Music player state maintained when hidden (no recreation)

---

## Accessibility

- Audio controls have ARIA labels
- Keyboard navigation supported
- Screen reader compatible
- Respects prefers-reduced-motion
