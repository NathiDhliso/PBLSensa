# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for implementing the Sensa Learn brand theme system - a foundational visual identity framework that will be used across both the PBL (Perspective-Based Learning) and Sensa Learn views of the application. This is a pure design system implementation focused exclusively on colors, gradients, animations, and visual brand identity. No feature logic or business functionality is included in this scope.

The brand theme system establishes a distinctive memory-focused color palette (avoiding common blue-green combinations) and provides reusable animation patterns that will be consumed by all future feature implementations.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Brand Color System Foundation

**User Story:** As a frontend developer, I want a centralized color system with TypeScript constants and CSS variables, so that I can consistently apply brand colors throughout the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the color system is implemented THEN it SHALL include all primary colors (Deep Amethyst #6B46C1, Warm Coral #F97316, Rich Plum #7C2D92)
2. WHEN the color system is implemented THEN it SHALL include all secondary colors (Golden Amber #F59E0B, Soft Rose #EC4899, Sage Green #10B981)
3. WHEN the color system is implemented THEN it SHALL include neutral colors with warm gray tones (Text Dark #1f2937, Text Medium #4b5563, Text Light #6b7280)
4. WHEN a developer imports the color constants THEN they SHALL be available as TypeScript constants with proper typing
5. WHEN the application loads THEN all colors SHALL be available as CSS custom properties in the :root element
6. WHEN using Tailwind CSS THEN all brand colors SHALL be available as utility classes (e.g., bg-deep-amethyst, text-warm-coral)

### Requirement 2: Brand Gradient System

**User Story:** As a frontend developer, I want predefined gradient combinations that represent the Sensa Learn brand identity, so that I can create visually consistent interfaces without manually defining gradients.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the gradient system is implemented THEN it SHALL include the "Memory to Learning" gradient (135deg, #6B46C1 0%, #F97316 100%)
2. WHEN the gradient system is implemented THEN it SHALL include the "Wisdom" gradient (135deg, #7C2D92 0%, #6B46C1 50%, #EC4899 100%)
3. WHEN the gradient system is implemented THEN it SHALL include the "Growth" gradient (135deg, #F59E0B 0%, #10B981 100%)
4. WHEN the gradient system is implemented THEN it SHALL include the "Transformation" gradient (135deg, #7C2D92 0%, #6B46C1 25%, #F97316 75%, #F59E0B 100%)
5. WHEN the gradient system is implemented THEN it SHALL include the "Subtle Background" gradient (135deg, #FAF5FF 0%, #FFF7ED 50%, #FDF2F8 100%)
6. WHEN using Tailwind CSS THEN all gradients SHALL be available as utility classes (e.g., bg-gradient-memory-learning)
7. WHEN using CSS THEN all gradients SHALL be available as CSS custom properties (e.g., var(--gradient-memory-learning))

### Requirement 3: Animation Framework with Framer Motion

**User Story:** As a frontend developer, I want reusable animation presets for common UI patterns, so that I can create consistent, smooth animations without writing repetitive motion code.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the animation framework is implemented THEN it SHALL provide page transition variants (initial, animate, exit states)
2. WHEN the animation framework is implemented THEN it SHALL provide notification pop-up animations (slide in from right with scale)
3. WHEN the animation framework is implemented THEN it SHALL provide looping animations (floating, spinner, pulse)
4. WHEN the animation framework is implemented THEN it SHALL provide 3D card flip animation function accepting isFlipped boolean
5. WHEN the animation framework is implemented THEN it SHALL provide hover and tap micro-interactions (scale effects)
6. WHEN the animation framework is implemented THEN it SHALL provide dynamic progress bar animation function accepting progress and totalSteps
7. WHEN the animation framework is implemented THEN it SHALL provide stagger container and item variants for list animations
8. WHEN a developer imports animation presets THEN they SHALL be compatible with Framer Motion's motion components

4. WHEN using Tailwind utilities THEN brand colors SHALL work with all standard modifiers (hover:, focus:, dark:, etc.)
5. WHEN the configuration is updated THEN it SHALL not override default Tailwind colors, only extend them

### Requirement 5: Global Styles and CSS Utilities

**User Story:** As a frontend developer, I want global CSS utilities for brand-specific effects, so that I can apply 3D transforms and gradient backgrounds without inline styles.

## Privacy and Security Considerations

This theme system implementation does not collect, store, or process any user data. All colors, gradients, and animations are static design assets that run entirely in the browser. No API calls or data transmission is involved in this foundational layer.

## Out of Scope

The following items are explicitly **NOT** included in this requirements document:

- Feature logic from PBL or Sensa Learn views
- Backend API integration
- User authentication or profile management
- Content management or data fetching
- Routing configuration beyond the root App component
- Component library implementation (buttons, cards, forms, etc.)
- Responsive design breakpoints (handled by Tailwind defaults)
- Accessibility features beyond color contrast (WCAG compliance for interactive elements will be addressed in component implementations)

## Dependencies

- React 18+
- TypeScript 5+
- Tailwind CSS 3+
- Framer Motion 10+
- Modern browser with CSS custom properties support

## Success Metrics

1. All brand colors are accessible via TypeScript constants, CSS variables, and Tailwind utilities
2. All brand gradients are accessible via TypeScript constants, CSS variables, and Tailwind utilities
3. Animation presets can be imported and applied to Framer Motion components with zero configuration
4. Developers can build new components using the theme system without defining custom colors or animations
5. The application background displays the branded gradient on all pages
6. TypeScript provides autocomplete and type checking for all theme utilities
7. No console errors or warnings related to theme system on application load
