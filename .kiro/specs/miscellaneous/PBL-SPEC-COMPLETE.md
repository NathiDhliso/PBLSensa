## What PBL View Does

The PBL View automatically:
1. **Extracts concepts** from PDF textbooks using Claude AI
2. **Classifies relationships** as hierarchical (is-a, has-component) or sequential (precedes, enables)
3. **Identifies duplicates** (e.g., "VM" and "Virtual Machine")
4. **Visualizes knowledge** as interactive, editable concept maps
5. **Supports multiple layouts** (tree, mind map, flowchart, hybrid)
6. **Enables full editing** (add, edit, delete nodes and edges)
7. **Exports diagrams** (PNG, PDF, JSON)
8. **Integrates with Sensa Learn** for personalized learning

## Architecture Highlights

### 5 Core Services

1. **ConceptExtractor**: PDF ‚Üí Concepts using Claude
2. **StructureClassifier**: Concepts ‚Üí Relationships (hierarchical/sequential)
3. **ConceptDeduplicator**: Finds and merges duplicates
4. **PBLVisualizationEngine**: Generates interactive diagrams
5. **PBL Pipeline**: Orchestrates everything

### Technology Stack

**Backend**:
- FastAPI (Python)
- PostgreSQL with pgvector
- AWS Bedrock (Claude 3.5 Sonnet)
- Redis caching
- Celery async processing

**Frontend**:
- React + TypeScript
- React Flow for visualization

## What Makes This Special

### 1. Structure-First Approach
Unlike traditional concept maps, PBL View **automatically detects** whether concepts are:
- **Hierarchical** (categories, components) ‚Üí Blue rectangular nodes
- **Sequential** (process steps) ‚Üí Green rounded nodes
- **Hybrid** ‚Üí Both types in one map

### 2. AI-Powered Intelligence
- Claude extracts concepts with context
- Pattern matching + AI validation for relationships
- Semantic similarity for deduplication
- Smart layout algorithms

### 3. Full User Control
- Every automated decision can be overridden
- Complete editing capabilities
- Multiple visualization styles
- Export in multiple formats

### 4. Integration Ready
- Clean interfaces for Sensa Learn
- Shared concept IDs
- Bidirectional navigation
- Visual connection indicators
