# ðŸš€ Start Your Local Backend

I've created a simple FastAPI backend for you! Here's how to get it running:

## Quick Start (3 Steps)

### 1. Open a New Terminal

Keep your frontend running in the current terminal, and open a **new terminal window**.

### 2. Navigate to Backend Directory

```bash
cd backend
```

### 3. Start the Backend

**Option A: Using PowerShell Script (Easiest)**
```powershell
.\start-backend.ps1
```

**Option B: Manual Start**
```bash
# Create virtual environment (first time only)
python -m venv venv

# Activate it
# On Windows:
venv\Scripts\activate

# On Mac/Linux:
source venv/bin/activate

# Install dependencies (first time only)
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Start the server
python main.py
```

## What You'll See

```
ðŸš€ Starting PBL Backend API on http://localhost:8000
ðŸ“š API Documentation: http://localhost:8000/docs
INFO:     Started server process
INFO:     Waiting for application startup.
INFO:     Application startup complete.
INFO:     Uvicorn running on http://0.0.0.0:8000
```

## Test It's Working

1. **Open your browser** to http://localhost:8000/docs
2. You should see the **Swagger API documentation**
3. Try the `/health` endpoint - it should return `{"status": "healthy"}`

## Update Your Frontend

Your `.env.local` is already configured to use the local backend:
```bash
VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8000
VITE_ENABLE_MOCK_API=false
```

**Restart your frontend dev server** (Ctrl+C and `npm run dev` again) to pick up the changes.

## What This Backend Does

âœ… **Course Management**
- Create, read, update, delete courses
- Track document counts

âœ… **Document Upload**
- Upload PDFs to courses
- Track processing status
- Delete documents

âœ… **Concept Maps**
- Generate sample concept maps
- View course and document maps

âœ… **CORS Enabled**
- Works with your frontend on localhost:5173

## No More Connection Errors! ðŸŽ‰

Once the backend is running, those `ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED` errors will disappear and your app will use real API calls instead of mock data.

## Troubleshooting

### "Python not found"
Install Python 3.11+ from https://www.python.org/downloads/

### "Port 8000 already in use"
Something else is using port 8000. Either:
1. Stop that service
2. Or change the port in `backend/main.py` (line at the bottom)

### "Module not found"
Make sure you ran:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Still seeing connection errors?
1. Check backend is running (you should see the uvicorn logs)
2. Check http://localhost:8000/health in your browser
3. Restart your frontend dev server
4. Check `.env.local` has `VITE_ENABLE_MOCK_API=false`

## Next Steps

Once everything is working:
1. âœ… Create courses through the UI
2. âœ… Upload documents (they'll be stored in memory)
3. âœ… View concept maps
4. âœ… Test all the navigation with real data

The backend uses in-memory storage, so data resets when you restart it. This is perfect for development!
