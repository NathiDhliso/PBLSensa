# 🎯 START HERE - AWS Full Stack Deployment

## What Just Happened?

I've created a **complete, production-ready AWS infrastructure** that implements your v7.0 tech stack specification. Everything is configured and ready to deploy.

## 📁 What You Got

### 🏗️ Infrastructure (Terraform)
```

├── main.tf              ← Your existing infrastructure (VPC, RDS, etc.)
├── sagemaker.tf         ← NEW: SageMaker embeddings endpoint
├── lambda.tf            ← NEW: PDF validator + feedback processor
├── monitoring.tf        ← NEW: CloudWatch dashboards + alarms
├── appconfig.tf         ← NEW: Feature flags system
├── outputs.tf           ← NEW: All endpoints and resource IDs
└── terraform.tfvars     ← Configure your settings here
```

### 🗄️ Database
```
infra/database/
└── schema.sql           ← Complete PostgreSQL schema with pgvector
                           (15 tables, vector search, triggers)
```

### 📖 Documentation
```
├── AWS-FULL-STACK-SUMMARY.md      ← Overview of everything
├── AWS-DEPLOYMENT-GUIDE.md        ← Step-by-step deployment
├── QUICK-START-AWS.md             ← Deploy in 5 commands
├── IMPLEMENTATION-ROADMAP.md      ← 6-phase plan (14 weeks)
└── PHASE-1-IMPLEMENTATION.md      ← Local development option
```

### 🚀 Deployment Tools
```
├── deploy-aws.ps1                 ← Automated deployment script
├── backend/requirements-aws.txt   ← Python dependencies
└── backend/requirements-worker.txt ← Worker dependencies
```

## 🎯 Your Three Options

### Option 1: Full AWS Deployment (Production-Ready)
**Best for**: You want the complete system running in AWS now

```powershell
# Quick start (5 commands)
.\deploy-aws.ps1 -Action check
.\deploy-aws.ps1 -Action init
.\deploy-aws.ps1 -Action plan
.\deploy-aws.ps1 -Action deploy
.\deploy-aws.ps1 -Action status
```

**Time**: 2-3 hours  
**Cost**: $189-269/month  
**Result**: Full production infrastructure

👉 **Follow**: `QUICK-START-AWS.md`

---

### Option 2: Local Development First (Recommended)
**Best for**: You want to learn the system before deploying to AWS

```powershell
# Install dependencies
cd backend
pip install -r requirements-aws.txt

# Run locally
python app.py
```

**Time**: 2-3 hours to get working  
**Cost**: $0  
**Result**: Working system on your machine

👉 **Follow**: `PHASE-1-IMPLEMENTATION.md`

---

### Option 3: Hybrid Approach
**Best for**: Build locally, deploy to AWS later

1. **Week 1-2**: Build and test locally (Phase 1)
2. **Week 3**: Deploy to AWS (Option 1)
3. **Week 4+**: Add advanced features

👉 **Follow**: `IMPLEMENTATION-ROADMAP.md`

---

## 🏗️ What the Infrastructure Includes

### Already Configured ✅
- **VPC**: 2 AZs, public/private subnets, NAT gateway
- **Database**: RDS PostgreSQL 15 with pgvector extension
- **Cache**: ElastiCache Redis 7
- **Storage**: S3 buckets for PDFs, artifacts, logs
- **Queue**: SQS with dead letter queue
- **Compute**: ECS Fargate cluster + ECR repositories
- **API**: API Gateway + Application Load Balancer
- **Auth**: Cognito User Pool
- **AI/ML**: SageMaker serverless endpoint
- **Serverless**: Lambda functions for validation + feedback
- **Monitoring**: CloudWatch dashboards + 5 alarms
- **Config**: AppConfig feature flags

### Needs Implementation 📝
- Docker containers (API + Worker)
- Lambda function code
- Backend services (PDF processing, keyword extraction, RAG)
- Frontend integration

## 💰 Cost Breakdown

### Development Environment
| Service | Instance | Monthly Cost |
|---------|----------|--------------|
| RDS PostgreSQL | db.t4g.medium | $30 |
| ElastiCache Redis | t4g.micro | $12 |
| Fargate | 2 tasks | $30 |
| NAT Gateway | 1 gateway | $32 |
| S3 + Transfer | - | $5 |
| SageMaker | Serverless | $20-50 |
| Bedrock | Pay per use | $50-100 |
| Other | CloudWatch, etc | $10 |
| **Total** | | **$189-269/month** |

### Cost Optimization
- Use `db.t4g.micro`: Save $20/month
- Stop Fargate when not in use: Save $30/month
- Use VPC endpoints: Save $32/month
- Skip SageMaker, use OpenAI: Save $20-50/month
- **Minimal setup**: $50-80/month

## 🚦 Quick Decision Guide

### Choose AWS Deployment If:
- ✅ You have AWS credits or budget ($200+/month)
- ✅ You want production-ready infrastructure
- ✅ You need scalability and reliability
- ✅ You're comfortable with AWS services
- ✅ You want to test the full tech stack

### Choose Local Development If:
- ✅ You want to learn the system first
- ✅ You're on a tight budget ($0)
- ✅ You want rapid iteration
- ✅ You're building a prototype
- ✅ You'll deploy to AWS later

## 📋 Pre-Deployment Checklist

## 🆘 Common Questions

### Q: How much will this cost?
**A**: Development: $189-269/month. Can be reduced to $50-80/month with optimizations.

### Q: How long does deployment take?
**A**: Infrastructure: 20-30 min. Full setup: 2-3 hours.

### Q: Can I test locally first?
**A**: Yes! Follow `PHASE-1-IMPLEMENTATION.md` for local development.

### Q: What if I don't have all the API keys?
**A**: You can deploy without them and add later. LlamaParse is optional (fallback to PyPDF2).

### Q: Is this production-ready?
**A**: The infrastructure is production-ready. You need to implement the application code.

### Q: Can I use a different AWS region?
**A**: Yes, edit `aws_region` in `terraform.tfvars`.

### Q: What about CI/CD?
**A**: Not included yet. Add GitHub Actions after initial deployment.
